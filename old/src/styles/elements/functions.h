/*
 * In ProffieOS, Fredrik has created what he calls "SVF"s or "Single Value Functions"
 * The apparent goal is to improve performance by only calculating one value for functions
 * which will have the same value for the entire blade.
 *
 * It's unclear to me exactly why this couldn't be accomplished by doing the calculation in the run()
 * function and then going from there, as that's what the SingleValueAdaptor does anyways, but that's
 * beyond the scope of recreating the style calculation system. 
 * (Thus the reason in ProffieConfig there's only a getInt())
 *
 * SVFs have a single "calculate" function which does the single calculation for the entire blade,
 * in the adapter this value is stored to a variable and then returned for any led getInt() is called
 * with, true to form.
 *
 * getInt() is the function that seems to be actually used by other *things* that expect a "function"
 * bladestyle, it takes in an led index and returns the appropriate value.
 * (It's worth noting that I'm referencing what ProffieOS calls "function" bladestyles and C++
 * functions back and forth here, and they're *NOT* the same thing)
