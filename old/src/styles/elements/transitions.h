/*
 * Well here we are again, it's always such a pleasure...
 * Trying to understand Transitions:
 *
 * TransitionBaseX<class MILLIS> functions:
 *
 * run(BladeBase* blade) -> TransitionStyle::run (will wrap virtual doRun call after setup)
 * bool done(); // Check if length? is equal to 0
 * bool restart(); // check reset var
 * void begin(); // set restart var to true to be check on next run() 
 *
 * uint32_t start_millis(); // Get start time in millis
 *
 * // Unsure what scale is supposed to be, checks to see if the transition is done.
 * // If so, scale is directly returned. (This will also update the state to a done state if it's crossed
 * // the threshold and hasn't been updated yet)... perhaps that's where the "update" name comes from?
 * // Otherwise, the MILLIS class, wrapped in AddBend<>, has bend called with the timeDelta, length, and scale
 * template<typename T>
 * T update(T scale); 
 *
 * Ok, so TrWipeX will be our example. It inherits publicly from TransitionBaseX<MILLIS>,
 * and on the surface it looks like a standard color function, with a run and getColor, however
 * the getColor is templated (of course it is), and the colors come from the getColor call, it doesn't
 * just take in the led index.
 *
 * (Sidenote, this'd mean that Transitions are particularly expensive in memory...)
 *
 * So it seems the special thing about transitions is that their getColor takes in colors, and
 * that they inherit (and use!) all the functions from TransitionBaseX.
 *
 * TransitionHelper<class T> function:
 *
 * void begin();
 * void run(BladeBase* blade)
 * operator bool();
 *
 * // If "active_", return T::getColor(a, b, int),
 * // else return b...
 * template<class A, class B>
 * Color getColor(A, B, int);
 *
 * Studying a "Layer" that takes in a transition,
 * InOutTrL wraps the "OutTr" and "InTr" input transition classes
 * in a "TransitionHelper"
 *
 * There's the actual "Transition Functions" as I'm dubbing them (this is getting complicated),
 * and then there's the elements that take in transitions, and they don't seem to be any different in
 * interface than a normal ColorStyle, so they'll probably go with those.
 *
 * The run function seems to serve the same role as always, doing
 * main setup, and getColor is pretty standard.
 *
